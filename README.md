### Christoph Honal

- Existence can be improved by technology.
- Strong crypto belongs to the people.
- Strive to save our planet, otherwise everything else is pointless.
- Always consider Open-Source.

Sometimes I blog at [chrz.de](https://chrz.de), and rarely check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoph-honal/). Reach me via Matrix at `/@stargate01:matrix.org`.

Most of the time I work for [zeromouse.de](https://zeromouse.de), [vivokey.com](https://vivokey.com), and whatever I find interesting:

- Hardware, firmware and interface engineering
- NFC, RFID and LoRa
- KeePassXC and YubiKey tools
- WebAuthN, FIDO2, and CTAP
- Custom firmware for NRF52-based smartwatches
- 3D-Printing, CAD and CAM
- Linux Servers, NixOS, Docker, essentially Devops for myself

In my time at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/) I focused on large-scale high-performance development, specifically for computational fluid dynamics.
